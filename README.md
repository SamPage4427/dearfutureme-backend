# Dear Future Me Backend

## About the project

The project is a MERN project, where the frontend mostly utilizes React with a Vite/React base, while the backend utilizes MongoDB, Express.js, and Node.

## Server Abilities

The server connects to the frontend where a user can:
- Signup and login to their account that is stored on the backend.
- Create letters and notes that are stored in the database and are only able to be accessed by the logged in user.
- Sends email with letter on the chosen date from the server.
- Will notify a user on the application when a letter is supposed to be written or if the user has been inactive for a while. (Potential email?)
